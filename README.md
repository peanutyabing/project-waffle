# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Project 1 - WAFFLE

Hello! Welcome to my first [Bootcamp](https://bc.rocketacademy.co/1-frontend/1.p-frontend-app) project, a clone of the WAFFLE game. Give it a try [here](https://peanutyabing.github.io/project-waffle/)!

I built this game to practice using React, and chose WAFFLE as I loved playing the [original game](https://wafflegame.net/) created by [James Robinson](https://twitter.com/jamesjessian).

Please tell me what you think and what other features you would like you see in the Discussions.
